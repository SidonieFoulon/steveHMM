Title: HMM parameters estimation with Baum-Welch algorithm and quasi-Newton method (Title Case)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Sidonie Foulon

Description: This package can be used to run HMM parameter estimation algorithms such as the Baum-Welch algorithm and the quasi-Newton L-BFGS-B algorithm, but also an accelerated EM algorithm called SQUAREM (Varadhan, 2008). We also created a new algorithm QNEM which mix the Baum-Welch and BFGS algorithms. The latter is more widely explain in an article soon to be published.
